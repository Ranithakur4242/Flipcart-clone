        discription: "The Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G has a tonne of incredible features and provides gorgeous photographs and a faultless user experience. Due to its 2 um pixel size, the 50 MP Sony IMX766 sensor on the Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G is able to capture more light and produce stunning low-light images. Additionally, this phone boasts an innovative OIS that works to reduce camera shake and provide steady, blur-free images, even in dim lighting conditions. An additional benefit of this phone is its 120 Hz Pro AMOLED display with adaptive sync, which provides a fluid, lively, and engaging user experience. You can enjoy this phone's MediaTek Dimesity 1080 processor efficiently since it has a big vapour chamber, a high CPU frequency, and compatibility with 10 5G bands."
